# Simple Arithmetic Computer - MIPS Assembly
by Tiffany Yu

This assembly code is an implementation of a simple arithmetic computer that checks
for the validity of the user input and computes the solution to simple math problems. 
Single character variables can be stored and used. This code recognizes parenthesis and follows the order
of operations. 

Code was written using the MARS MIPS simulator.
